                        Grodno State Medical University was founded in 1958 and is the oldest medical school in Belarus. It specialises in medicine and medical psychology. The first autopsy in Eastern Europe, on King Stefan Batory, was conducted in Grodno in 1586 and there was a medical faculty in the city as early as 1775.It started as a single-department institution and has since added departments of preparation in 1970 and paediatrics in 1979 before, in 1991, starting the first department of nursing in newly-independent Belarus. It achieved university status in 2000 and now has six faculties: general medicine; paediatrics; psychology; diagnostics (which includes nursing), and a faculty specifically for international students, as well as a research school with centres devoted to 11 specialisms. There are three doctoral schools also affiliated with the institution and Grodno State Medical University works in partnership with four hospitals in the city as well as specialised facilities for psychology and narcology, cardiology and perinatal care. It has published its own academic journal since 2002.It describes itself as having "formed its own traditions and strong scientific schools". All courses are offered in Russian, with some courses offering teaching in a mix of Russian and English.

                        Belarus, officially the Republic of Belarus, is a landlocked country in Eastern Europe. It is bordered by Russia to the east and northeast, Ukraine to the south, Poland to the west, and Lithuania and Latvia to the northwest. Covering an area of 207,600 square kilometres (80,200 sq mi) and with a population of 9.3 million, Belarus is the thirteenth-largest and the twentieth-most populous country in Europe. The country is administratively divided into seven regions. Minsk is the capital and largest city. Until the 20th century, different states at various times controlled the lands of modern-day Belarus, including Kievan Rus', the Principality of Polotsk, the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, and the Russian Empire. In the aftermath of the Russian Revolution in 1917, different states arose competing for legitimacy amidst the Civil War, ultimately ending in the rise of the Byelorussian SSR, which became a founding constituent republic of the Soviet Union in 1922. After the Polish-Soviet War, Belarus lost almost half of its territory to Poland. Much of the borders of Belarus took their modern shape in 1939, when some lands of the Second Polish Republic were reintegrated into it after the Soviet invasion of Poland, and were finalized after World War II. During World War II, military operations devastated Belarus, which lost about a quarter of its population and half of its economic resources. The republic was redeveloped in the post-war years. In 1945, the Byelorussian SSR became a founding member of the United Nations, along with the Soviet Union.

                            The legacy of the state atheism of the Soviet era is
                            evident in the fact that a part of the Belarusians
